# PR Plan: Implement Working Agent Pipeline

## Summary
The current project manages database connections and provides an API, but natural language queries are not translated to SQL yet. This PR will introduce a minimal Text2SQL agent and connect it with the existing backend.

## Tasks
1. **Agent Module**
   - Create a new `backend/agent/` package.
   - Implement a simple NL2SQL function using `openai` as a placeholder.
2. **API Endpoint**
   - Add `/api/agent/query` endpoint that accepts a natural language query, converts it to SQL via the agent and executes it using `ConnectionManager`.
3. **Frontend Support**
   - Add a call in the frontend to use the new endpoint from the IDE page.
4. **Documentation**
   - Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with the new agent feature.
5. **Tests**
   - Add basic unit tests for the agent module.

Running `pytest -q` should succeed after the changes.
